# infrastructure

Repo for the UMCCR compute infrastructure as code.

We are making all our infrastructure code public based on referents like [18F](https://github.com/18F), [Fedora Infra](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/) and other opensource projects.  **Public funding, public code.**

If you found some sensitive material such as keys, certificates that might been exposed by accident, please report to **services at umccr dot org** ASAP.

You may want to clone it with: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/umccr/infrastructure.git`
